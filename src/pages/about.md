#### Staff Scientist at Aalto University | SPE at European Data Protection Board | EOSC Ethics Advisor

I am a staff scientist at the **Aalto University School of Science** and a core member of the **Aalto Scientific Computing** team, where we manage the Triton high-performance computing cluster, provide large-scale storage, and support researchers with scientific software, data workflows, and secure computing.

I design and teach hands-on courses on **Python for scientific computing**, **high-performance computing (HPC)**, and **reproducibility**. A key part of my work involves training researchers on handling **personal data** in research projects — including privacy enhancing technologies and secure computing environments. I co-teach the mandatory course on **"Research Ethics"** for all doctoral students at Aalto University. I work as a statistician and technical expert in studies involving neuroimaging, medical imaging, behavioural, and physiological data.

My research background is in **cognitive neuroscience**, focusing on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study brain networks, social cognition, and emotional processing. I’ve contributed software tools and methods for mapping bodily experiences of emotion and intersubject brain synchronization. Recently I have contributed to developing responsible practices of using generative AI in research and education.

I’m also active in open science policy and promotion of best practices. I serve as a member of the **European Data Protection Board’s Support Pool of Experts (SPE)**, where I contribute to open training materials on **AI, cybersecurity, and data protection**. I am a founding member of the **Finnish Reproducibility Network**, and part of **CodeRefinery**, a Nordic initiative to teach best practices for computational reproducibility. I have served as external ethics advisor for EOSC, and have contributed to peer review for 100+ papers and grant applications.

I am an activist trying to bring a change on issues about equality and inclusivity for women in STEM: I am the main organizers of the “[Making Waves](https://www.aalto.fi/en/making-waves/making-waves-events-series)” initiative. I am an elected member of the Aalto Academic Affairs Committee representing researchers and research support personnel. Please feel free to contact me to discuss any matter listed in this short description.

Originally from San Donà di Piave, Italy, I earned my MSc in Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Padua and completed my D.Sc. (PhD) in Cognitive Science at Aalto University with distinction.
