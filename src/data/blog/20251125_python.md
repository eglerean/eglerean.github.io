I organized and hosted "Python for Scientific Computing 2025", a three-day online workshop (November 25-27) streamed via Twitch.

This medium-advanced course covers essential Python tools for researchers who want to understand important libraries for science and how scientists typically use Python.

**Topics covered**:
- Jupyter notebooks
- NumPy and data structures
- Pandas for data analysis
- Xarray for multidimensional data
- Plotting with Vega-Altair
- Profiling and optimization
- Parallel programming
- Packaging and dependency management

**Instructors**: Richard Darst, myself, Johan Hellsvik, Diana Iusan, Ashwin Mohanan, Thomas Pfau, and others from partner organizations across Nordic universities.
