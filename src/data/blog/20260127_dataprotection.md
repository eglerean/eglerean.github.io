I organized and was the main teacher of the "Hands-on Data Protection" workshop, a practical two-day online event (January 27 and 29, 2026).

The workshop aimed to familiarize participants with data protection concepts in research and teach them to minimize, pseudonymize, and anonymize personal data in its many forms.

- Dr. Essi Viitanen (Senior Advisor, Data Agent, Aalto University)
- Dr. Francesca Morello (Sensitive Data Services, CSC)
- Dr. Kimmo Mattila (Sensitive Data Services, CSC)

**Topics covered**:
- Data protection principles and personal data lifecycle
- Planning: data management plans, privacy notices, ethical reviews
- Data collection, reuse, preservation, sharing, and publishing
- Data preprocessing and anonymization
- Secure computing workflows for qualitative data (transcription, analysis)
- Secure computing workflows for quantitative data (synthetic data, pseudonymization)
