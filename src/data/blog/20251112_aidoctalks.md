I hosted the AI-DOC Expert Talks as part of the AI-DOC Research Seminar week at Aalto University.

The day featured sessions on:
- **AI Ethical and Legal Challenges** with prof. Arno Solin and senior legal counsel Maria Rehbinder
- **AI for Science and Engineering: Methods and Applications** with NVIDIA representative Niki Loppi

This was part of a larger seminar week that included my reproducibility workshop on the 11th just before the "AI Day" event by FCAI.
