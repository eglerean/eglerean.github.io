description: Workshop on responsible use of generative AI in research for the Department of Film
---

I gave a workshop on "Responsible Use of Generative AI in Research" for Prof. Susanna Helke and the doctoral researchers of the Department of Film at Aalto University.

The workshop also featured Katri Manninen, who gave an excellent and practical overview on how she creates film scripts with generative AI tools.

The session combined my perspective on responsible AI use in academic research with practical creative applications in script writing.
