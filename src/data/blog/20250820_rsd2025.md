I gave a talk on responsible AI in research at the data management working group meeting during Research Service Days 2025 (Tutkimuspalvelupäivät) in Tampere.

Research Service Days is an annual professional event for research administration and management experts at universities and research institutes, hosted this year by Tampere University and TAMK.

More information about the event at the [RSD2025 website](https://events.tuni.fi/rsd2025-en/).
