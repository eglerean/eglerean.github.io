description: Hosted the third Triton user group meeting at Aalto University
---

I hosted the third Triton Users' Group meeting for users of Aalto University's high-performance computing cluster.

The hybrid event (in-person at Top Lounge U523 and online) focused on "Triton: past, present, and future" and was open to all Aalto members who use or have used the HPC resources.

These meetings help us gather feedback from users and share updates about system improvements and future development priorities.
