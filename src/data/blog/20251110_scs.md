description: Presentation about the new 5 ECTS Scientific Computing Skills course at the CSC Ambassadors meeting

I presented at the CSC Scientific Computing Ambassadors meeting about the new "Scientific Computing Skills" (SCS) course at Aalto University.

**The challenge**: Doctoral students need computing skills (shell, coding, git, HPC), and quality courses exist, but students struggled to receive official credits for them.

**The solution**: A structured 5 ECTS course with five modules (1 credit each):
1. Basic scientific project management (CodeRefinery)
2. Programming language training
3. Intro to HPC (ASC HPC kickstart or CSC/LUMI equivalent)
4. Linux shell self-learning
5. Additional courses or RSE-reviewed projects

The course launched in August 2025. Students accumulate points annually and redeem them in June.
