I was invited to give an online lecture at the Geological Survey of Finland (GTK), together with my colleague Dr. Pedro Silva from Aalto University.

The workshop targeted researchers, doctoral students, and academic staff interested in understanding how generative AI and Large Language Models are transforming research practices.

**Topics covered**:
- Fundamental concepts of generative AI
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Practical research workflows incorporating AI
- Legal and ethical considerations
