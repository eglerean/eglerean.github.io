description: Outlining the cases for using generative AI tools compatible with research integrity
---

In the mandatory Research Ethics course for all doctoral researchers at Aalto University, I taught about the use of generative AI tools and responsible conduct of research.

Lecture went a bit overtime, but hopefully the message was clear...?

Slides coming.
