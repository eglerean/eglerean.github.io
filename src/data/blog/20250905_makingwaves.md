description: Organized Making Waves breakfast event on diversity and inclusion in physics
---

I organized the Making Waves Breakfast event "Challenges and Solutions" together with the PHYSics Diversity Team at Aalto University.

**Speakers**:

- **Prof. Marilù Chiofalo** (University of Pisa) - "Subjectivity and Objectivity in Science: a Gender Perspective"
  - Addressed how gender perspectives influence scientific evaluation processes and unconventional interdisciplinary careers

- **Dr. Tzula Propp** - "Mentorship, Failure, and Queerness: Building Resilience and Community in Physics"
  - Focused on mentorship without representation and preventing activist burnout in diversity work

The event explored creating inclusive environments in physics and science, covering topics like gender in science, mentorship, community building, peer support networks, and inclusion strategies for underrepresented groups.
