I participated as a panelist at the "ELEC Doctoral Students Meet Up and Panel Discussion on Research Ethics" at Aalto University.

**Other panelists**: Essi Viitanen and Juho Pokki

The event brought together doctoral students from the School of Electrical Engineering to discuss research ethics, integrity, and responsible conduct of research.
