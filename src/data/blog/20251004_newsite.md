description: A new website powered by Astro with a modified AstroPaper template.

Not much to add except that I have finally updated my website! It was not easy to choose the right framework. I still wanted it to be updatable via git and since I have been using GitHub pages for years, I was searching for the right template system. 

I have used for years the GitHub template ["Academic Pages"](https://academicpages.github.io/) which is based on Jekyll. It was a very useful template but it was too tedious to update. I have then explored multiple options: Quarto, Zola, Sphnix,... and in the end Astro. I am very happy with Astro, the syntax is straight forward and I can customize the look and feel of the site.

If you want to check the source code of this size, please visit my github profile.
