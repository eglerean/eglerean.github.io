description: Talk on responsible use of generative AI to high school students in Pudasjärvi
---

I gave a talk to high school (lukio) students in Pudasjärvi about responsible use of generative AI. This was part of the [Meet a Researcher](https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/en/meet-a-researcher/) program by Young Academy Finland, which connects researchers with classrooms throughout Finland.

**Topics covered**:
- Ethical AI principles: sustainability, safety, accountability, fairness, explainability
- Why major commercial AI companies often fail to implement these principles
- Serious harms: youth safety, exploitation of workers, environmental unsustainability
- The proper role of AI: routine tasks that free humans for creative work
