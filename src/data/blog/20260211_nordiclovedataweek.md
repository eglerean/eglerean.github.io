description: Talk at Nordic Love Data Week questioning blanket open data policies and advocating for quality over quantity
---

I gave a presentation at [Nordic Love Data Week 2026](https://www.nordiclovedataweek.org/agenda/#feb-11-wed) on February 11, as part of the Wednesday afternoon session (13:00–14:30 CET).

The talk was titled **"Data Available on Unreasonable Request"**, a deliberately provocative title that questions the assumption that all research data should be made openly available by default.

The core argument: not all datasets are worth opening. I am sorry, I know you love your data and you think it is the most imporant data in the world, but often its reuse value is close to zero. Setting"blanket" open-data policies can waste resources and create a flood of low-quality, poorly documented datasets that nobody reuses. Instead, we should be honest about when data openness genuinely serves science, and focus our efforts on datasets that have real discovery potential:curated, well-documented, and reusable.

The session also included a talk on responsible data preservation by Mari Elisa Kuusiniemi from the University of Helsinki, making for a nice pairing of perspectives on data preservation and reuse.
