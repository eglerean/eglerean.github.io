I was invited to give an online lecture at Riga Stradins University (RSU) on "AI in Research Work", together with my colleague Dr. Pedro Silva from Aalto University.

The workshop, organized in collaboration between RSU and Aalto University, targeted researchers, doctoral students, and academic staff interested in understanding how generative AI and Large Language Models are transforming research practices.

**Topics covered**:
- Fundamental concepts of generative AI
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Practical research workflows incorporating AI
- Legal and ethical considerations
- Data security implications
