description: Post about Aalto AI Talks number 2

Today, with the great help of other Aalto colleagues, I am hosting AI Talks #2 - Teaching and Learning with AI.                                               
How can we responsibly adopt AI tools in studying and teaching? In this event, we present an overview of AI pedagogy with examples and experiences from Aalto University teachers, students, learning services, and support staff.
