description: Organized event on understanding and preventing workplace ostracism
---

I organized the "Making Waves" event on workplace ostracism at Aalto University.

**Speaker**: Dr. Sirpa Manninen, a researcher specializing in workplace ostracism and organizational social dynamics.

The session explored what happens when employees experience quiet exclusion or communication gaps. Dr. Manninen discussed how ostracism differs from bullying, the psychological mechanisms driving its harm, and concrete approaches for building inclusive workplace cultures.

Key topics included:
- How ostracism manifests in organizations
- Effects on employee wellbeing and organizational trust
- The role of leadership in reducing exclusion
- Interventions to prevent exclusionary practices
