description: Talk at the National Open Science and Research network advocating for data quality over quantity
---

I was invited to speak at the National Open Science and Research network (Avointiede) about research data sharing practices.

My key argument: instead of mandating open access to all research data, we should prioritize **data quality**. I presented three recommendations:

1. Replace "data available on reasonable request" with honest language: "this data is not worth sharing, but we have an internal copy if you want to verify things"
2. Conduct data appraisal during the planning stage, not after collection
3. When data is valuable, involve organizational stakeholders (legal, ethics, IT, research data experts) in developing high-quality datasets

The presentation emphasized using carefully designed registered reports with peer review *before* data collection.
