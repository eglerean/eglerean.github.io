description: Slides from my lecture at course Research Methods in Industrial Engineering and Management
---

Today, with my great colleagues from Aalto University Dr. Annukka Jyrämä and Dr. Antti Rousi, we were invited to talk about research ethics and research integrity at Henri Schildt's course "Research Methods in Industrial Engineering and Management" for doctoral students.

This time I focused on **Research Integrity**, the pricinples of ALLEA code of conduct, and what is considered as misconduct. I have also expanded on the concept of "questionable research practices" and other sloppy use of tools, such as novel generative AI tools: the perfect fabrication, falsification, plagiarism machines.

The slides for my lecture (work in progress) are [available at this link](../../assets/docs/EthicsIngegrityCompliance.pdf).
