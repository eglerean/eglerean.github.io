description: Guest lecture on ethics and privacy for the Digital Health and Human Behavior course
---

I was a guest lecturer for the "Ethics and Privacy" session at the CS-C4100 Digital Health and Human Behavior course, organized by dr. Talayeh Aledavood.

The course examines how digital traces from connected devices and online platforms reveal human behavior patterns, with applications to health and well-being contexts.

**Topics I covered**:
- Privacy and ethics in data collection
- Personal data handling under GDPR
- Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)
- AI ethics and other general considerations on privacy and the intersection between law and ethics.
